### Usage
- This code is compatible with Python 2.7, to create a Python environment similar to what was used for this project:
    1. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section) with Python 2.7
    2. Create Anaconda environment from our `config/CBIG_RNN_python_env.yml` file by `conda env create -f config/CBIG_RNN_python_env.yml`
- An example of how to use the code is detailed in `examples/README.md`.
